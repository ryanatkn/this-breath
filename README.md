## tech

Made with canvas and TypeScript and formatted with
[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier).
Normally I'd install hundreds of megabytes of
JavaScript for a hello world on the web,
but to mirror the tool's minimalism,
I opted for a single script file with no dependencies.
It grew bigger than I expected, mainly because of all of the settings.
I also ignored a lot of best practices (there are globals everywhere!),
so it's not a good project to learn from.

## develop

```bash
npm i
npm start
firefox index.html # open `index.html` in your browser
```
